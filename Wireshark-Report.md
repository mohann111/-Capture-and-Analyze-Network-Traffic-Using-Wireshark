- Network Analyzer: Wireshark (latest version)
- Network Interface: eth0 (Ethernet adapter)
- Source IP Address: 192.168.100.3

**Capture Process**:
1. Launched Wireshark with appropriate permissions
2. Selected active network interface (eth0)
3. Initiated packet capture
4. Generated network traffic through web browsing and server pinging
5. Captured traffic for approximately 1-2 minutes
6. Stopped capture and applied various display filters
7. Exported capture as `.pcap` file for archival

### Traffic Generation Methods

During the capture session, the following activities generated network traffic:
- Web browsing to Google services (www.google.com, www.googleadservices.com)
- HTTPS connections establishing encrypted sessions
- DNS queries for domain name resolution
- Background certificate validation (OCSP)
- TCP connection establishments and data transfers

## Advanced Display Filter Examples

### Protocol-Specific Filters

**HTTP Advanced Filters**:
```
http.request.method == "GET"                    # GET requests only
http.request.method == "POST"                   # POST requests only  
http.response.code == 200                       # Successful responses
http.host == "www.google.com"                   # Specific host traffic
http.request.uri contains "search"              # URI pattern matching
http.cookie                                     # Packets with cookies
```

**TCP Advanced Filters**:
```
tcp.flags.syn == 1 and tcp.flags.ack == 0      # New connection attempts
tcp.analysis.retransmission                     # Retransmitted packets
tcp.window_size == 0                            # Buffer full conditions
tcp.len > 0                                     # Packets with payload data
tcp.dstport == 80                               # Destination port specific
tcp.srcport == 443                              # Source port specific
```

**DNS Advanced Filters**:
```
dns.qry.name == "www.google.com"               # Specific domain query

## Key Findings and Insights

### Network Behavior

1. **Dual-Stack DNS**: System performs both IPv4 (A) and IPv6 (AAAA) lookups
2. **Certificate Validation**: Active OCSP checks ensure SSL/TLS certificate validity
3. **Encryption Adoption**: Majority of web traffic uses HTTPS (TLS 1.3)
4. **Connection Persistence**: TCP keepalive maintains long-lived connections
5. **Protocol Distribution**: TCP dominates with 85%+ of captured traffic

### Security Observations

1. **Clear-text HTTP**: Some traffic still uses unencrypted HTTP (port 80)
2. **Modern TLS**: TLSv1.3 implementation shows up-to-date security practices
3. **Certificate Checking**: OCSP validation active for certificate revocation
4. **DNS Privacy**: DNS queries transmitted in clear-text (no DNS-over-HTTPS)
5. **Browser Security**: User-Agent shows current Firefox version with security features

### Performance Indicators

1. **Window Sizes**: 64KB-65KB windows indicate good network performance
2. **Minimal Retransmissions**: Few TCP analysis flags suggest stable connection
3. **Quick DNS Resolution**: Fast query-response times (~190ms)
